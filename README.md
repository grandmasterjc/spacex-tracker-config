# SpaceX Tracker — Content Repo

## Launch Monitor

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/launch-monitor.yml`) runs every 10 minutes and monitors SpaceX launches for schedule changes and outcomes.

### How it works

1. Polls the [Launch Library 2](https://thespacedevs.com/llapi) API for upcoming and recent SpaceX launches
2. Compares against saved state in `state/launch_state.json`
3. Detects **reschedules** (NET moved by >= 5 minutes for launches within ±48h) and **outcomes** (Success / Failure / Partial Failure)
4. Sends FCM push notifications (in Norwegian) to the `all` topic
5. Commits updated state back to the repo

### Bootstrap mode (first run)

When `state/launch_state.json` is empty or has no launches, the script enters **bootstrap mode**:

- Fetches all current launches (upcoming + recent previous) from LL2
- Populates the state file with these launches as the baseline
- **Does NOT send any notifications** — avoids flooding users with stale outcomes
- Logs: `[BOOTSTRAP] Initialized state with N launches. No notifications sent.`
- Subsequent runs will diff against this baseline and only notify on real changes

Dry-run mode also shows bootstrap behavior (without committing state).

### Notification cap

As a safety measure, if more than `MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_RUN` events (default: **5**) are detected in a single run, only the **3 most recent** (by launch NET) are sent. The rest are skipped and logged as a warning. This prevents accidental flooding if state gets corrupted or reset.

Override via environment variable:

```
MAX_NOTIFICATIONS_PER_RUN=10
```

### Notifications

All push notifications are in Norwegian (Bokmål) and sent to the FCM topic `all`.

| Event | Example title | Example body |
|-------|--------------|--------------|
| Reschedule | Oppskytning flyttet | Falcon 9 Block 5 \| Starlink Group 17-16 er flyttet til 27. apr kl 18:30 |
| Success | Suksess | Falcon 9 Block 5 \| Starlink Group 17-16 ble vellykket skutt opp |
| Failure | Feil | Falcon 9 Block 5 \| Starlink Group 17-16: oppskytning mislyktes |
| Partial Failure | Delvis vellykket | Falcon 9 Block 5 \| Starlink Group 17-16: delvis vellykket oppskytning |

### Secrets

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | Firebase service account JSON (must have `firebase.messaging` scope). The `project_id` field is used to target the correct FCM project. |

### Manual testing

Trigger the workflow manually via `workflow_dispatch` with dry-run mode:

```
gh workflow run launch-monitor.yml -f dry_run=true
```

In dry-run mode the script logs what notifications would be sent without actually calling FCM or committing state changes.

Content delivery for the SpaceX Tracker iOS app. Articles and images are served via GitHub Pages and fetched at runtime by the app.

## Structure

```
updates/
├── manifest.json          # Production manifest (live to all users)
├── manifest-draft.json    # Draft manifest (DEBUG preview mode only)
├── articles/              # Markdown article bodies
│   ├── welcome-to-mission-control.md
│   ├── starship-flight-test-overview.md
│   └── mission-control-premium-guide.md
└── images/                # Hero images (1200x675 JPEG)
    ├── hero_welcome.jpg
    ├── hero_starship.jpg
    └── hero_premium.jpg
```

## Publishing workflow

1. Edit or add an article in `updates/articles/`
2. Drop the hero image in `updates/images/` (1200x675 JPEG, ~85% quality)
3. Update `manifest-draft.json` first — verify it renders via DEBUG preview mode in the app
4. When ready, promote the entry to `manifest.json` and commit
5. Optional: send a FCM push with `article_id` in the data payload to deep-link
